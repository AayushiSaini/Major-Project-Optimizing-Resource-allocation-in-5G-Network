# Major-Project-Optimizing: Resource-Allocation in 5G Network
The project focuses on enhancing resource allocation in 5G networks through the implementation of machine learning models, namely linear regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor (KNN)
The objective of our project is to predict and optimize Resource parameters such as bandwidth and frequency allocation based on historical network data and users behavior trends.
